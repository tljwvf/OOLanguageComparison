# Multithreading
## Swift

To accomplish mutlithreading in Swift, the user must use the object oriented class Grand Central Dispatch. For example:

    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {  
        // Download file or perform expensive task

        DispatchQueue.main.async {  
            // Update the UI  
        }
    }
    
This code would create an asynchronous task that would first download then update the UI. Grand Central Dispatch has multiple options for concurrent execution
such as async() and after() to delay a task.
