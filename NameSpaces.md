# Name Spaces
## Swift

The most common way to create a name space in Swift is to use structures. These can then be used as a universally easy to understand constant. That can store important information within the structure.

    struct API {

    static let BaseURL = "https://example.com/v1/"
    static let Token = "sdfiug8186qf68qsdf18389qsh4niuy1"
    
    }
