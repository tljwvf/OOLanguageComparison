# Memory Management
## Swift
For the most part, Swift handles allocating and deallocating memory on a user's behalf throughout the program. Swift is able to do this thanks to a technlogy known
as Automatic Reference Counting. This is an automatic system that is able to predictably and efficiently use resources within an environment. 
This means that the user does not have to explicity state the resources that need to be used, but the user does still need to monitor relationships between objects to avoid memory leaks. Automatic Reference Counting also handles garbage collection so the user does not have to handle it.
