# Procedural / Functional Programming
##  Swift

Swift is not a functional language, but a user definitely can still code in a functional style using Swift. Swift is definitely not a purely functional language such as Haskell,
but it is more than an ordinary object oriented language. For example, mutability of data structures is a big part of a function language, which Swift definitely supports. Swift also uses
expanded value types that allow the language to be closer to a functional language. Also, in Swift functions are first class types which means they are data the same way in which instances of classes are. In sum,
Swift is not a functional language but it does support a lot of the concepts of functional programming.

Swift is also not a procedural language, but an object oriented lanaguage. So it may be possible to code in a somewhat procedural style, but not entirely.


## C#

C# supports both functional programming and procedural programming.
