# Language Purpose

## Swift
Swift was created as a general purpose and multi-paradigm language by Apple to replace Objective-C. It was created to work for Appleâ€™s current operating systems such as iOS, macOS, and watchOS. It was designed to be safer than Objective-C, more dynamic, and to contain more extensible programming features. It was also created to address common problems such as null pointers and adds the concept of protocol extensibility. Swift was created based on several different programming languages such as Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, C#, and Ruby.

## C#
This language was Microsoft take on OO languages. The reason why it was created was to allow developers to create software for complex systems and basic in alike. Some of the problems that C# tried to address was the issue in stability. C# tries to make their language more thread friendly and healthier for larger systems.
